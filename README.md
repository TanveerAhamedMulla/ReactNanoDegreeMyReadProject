## Project: My Reads

## Project Overview
In the MyReads project, I have created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

### How to install
1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm start`

App should open at "localhost:3000/"
